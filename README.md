# Speed dating: visualization project

> Jedha Data Science Bootcamp - Fullstack - week 2

> _Session dsmft-paris-08_

Using the [Speed dating data](https://www.kaggle.com/annavictoria/speed-dating-experiment/) kaggle dataset, I made some visualizations and a descriptive analysis of the factors determining the chance to have a second date.

This dataset was created during a study made by the [Columbia Business School](http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/emir.kamenica/documents/genderDifferences.pdf).
This study observes dating behaviours during experimental speed datings; the participants were volunteers and were ask to complete questionnaires asking for their expectations.
During the speed dating, after a 4 minutes long meeting, the participants were asked to give some notation to the mate and whether or not they would like to have a second date.

The characteristics evaluated:
* Attractiveness
* Sincerity
* Intelligence
* Fun
* Ambition
* Shared Interests

## Top results

Expectations are different between men (homme) and women (femme):

The **characteristics** witch make the _**main differences**_ between genders:
- _women_ : **Ambition**, Sincerity, Same race, Same religion
- _men_ : **Attractiveness**

### The most influential characteristics: *Intelligence* and *Sincerity*
_Attractiveness_ seemed to be important for men,
but when the decision for the second date is made, **Intelligence** and **Sincerity**
are well noted by the men:
